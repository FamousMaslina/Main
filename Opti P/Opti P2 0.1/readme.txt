Opti P2 - an "OS" made in Python. (written for Version 0.1)

made for fun, of course, and it's pretty nice, tbh. It's inspired by MSDOS and so on.


How to use:

Classification:
op2.py - Main File (Needed)
bios.py - Secondary File (Needed by op2.py to run)
bios.ini - Config File for bios.py (Not needed)

Execution:
Execute op2.py and it should run fine. (Executing bios.py directly will not do anything!)

How to?
After executing op2.py, and you see the O:/>  then it's good to go! Execute the command 'help' for more info.
When executing op2.py, you'll see the bios loading. If it says bios.ini found, then it's ok. If not, then execute op2.py,
execute 'bios' and select option 2 by writing '2'. It creates the config file automatically and it should be fine.
