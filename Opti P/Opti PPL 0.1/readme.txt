Opti PPL - an "OS" made in Python. (written for Version 0.1| API Version 0.5)

made for fun, of course, and it's pretty nice, tbh. It's inspired by MSDOS and so on.

Scroll all the way down for the update log!


How to use:

Classification:
op2.py - Main File (Needed)
bios.py - Secondary File (Needed by op2.py to run)
op2api.py - API for op2.py (NEEDED)
op2v.py - Version file for op2.py and op2api.py (NEEDED!)
bios.ini - Config File for bios.py (Not needed)  
write.py - Extra (Not needed)
'hardware' - NEEDED FOLDER!

How to?
Check if the root directory has any hardware files. If not, Opti P2 will not run. If it dosen't check the 'hardware' folder and
copy one of the files from there to the root directory where op2.py, bios.py is.
Execute op2.py and it should run fine. (Executing bios.py directly will not do anything!)
After executing op2.py, and you see the O:/>  then it's good to go! Execute the command 'help' for more info.
When executing op2.py, you'll see the bios loading. If it says bios.ini found, then it's ok. If not, then execute op2.py,
execute 'bios' and select option 2 by typing '2'. It creates the config file automatically and it should be fine.
You can also install GPUs or Modem by copying one of the files from the 'gpus' (or modems) folder to the directory where op2.py is!


Custom apps Documentation:
All the custom apps, made by me are located in the
'Custom apps (OP2)' folder.
(Make sure to copy op2api.py in the cwd if the OP2 Version you're running is lower than 0.6)
